## About Me

I currently work as the Principal Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a> in Nigeria, where I lead a small team of ML Engineers at the GreyAI Lab. Our primary focus is on cross-lingual translation, particularly for low-resource languages like Hausa. Additionally, I hold the position of CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://app.5minutes.ng">5Minutes </a>(Beta version available on Google Play Store) at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a>. <a href="https://app.5minutes.ng">5Minutes </a> is a mentor-mentee platform emphasizing brevity in content (videos, texts) without compromising depth.

My educational background includes an MSc. degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the Institute for Digital Technologies at  <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/study/masters-degrees/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/"> Loughborough University London </a> (awarded a fully-funded merit-based scholarship),where I was advised by <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/about/staff/dr-xiaolan-liu/">Dr Xiaolan Liu.</a> I also earned a BSc. degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://unijos.edu.ng">University of Jos, Nigeria</a>, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q9VpwWEAAAAJ&hl=enDr. Nentawe Gurumdimma)"> Dr. Nentawe Gurumdimma</a> as my advisor during my undergraduate project. This project focused on the automatic screening of precancerous cervical lesions from pap smear images using transfer learning. My dedication to research led to a research assistantship position in an <a href="https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/K43-TW011416-02">NIH-funded project</a> (Vaginal Microbiome in Cervical Intra-Epithelial Neoplasia and Cancer, NIH grant, K43 project: K43TW011416-02) with <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=39806"> Prof. Musa Jonah </a> as the Principal Investigator. This project aimed at increasing cervical cancer screening uptake and reducing mortality in Nigeria.

I am an active member of <a href="http://www.sigecom.org">ACM Special Interest Group (SIGecom) </a> since 2020, as well as being affiliated with <a href="https://blackinai.github.io/#/">Black in AI</a> and <a href="https://www.datasciencenigeria.org">Data Scientists Network</a> formerly known as Data Science Nigeria.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I derive immense pleasure from both watching and participating in various sports, especially football. My unwavering allegiance to <a href="https://www.arsenal.com">Arsenal FC</a> is rooted in my childhood admiration for <a href="https://www.footballhistory.org/player/thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry,</a> whom I consider Gunner's Greatest of all Times.

Two quotes that resonate with me are, <strong><i> "If you do not strive for excellence in your endeavours, you have lost your purpose."</i> </strong> by <a href="https://manzomaigari.com/#/">Dr. Manzo Maigari</a>, and <strong> <i>"Sincerity is a better 'persuasion tactic' than any trick you can learn,"</i> </strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/1336432412285231104">Michael.</a>
