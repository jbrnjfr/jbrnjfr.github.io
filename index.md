## About Me


I'm the Principal Machine learning Scientist at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a> in Nigeria, where I lead a small team that mostly works on cross-lingual translation of low-resource languages particularly the Hausa Language.  I received a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Loughborough University London and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Jos, Nigeria.

Feel free email me for research, collaborations, or a casual chat. I especially encourage junior, disadvantaged, or underrepresented students to reach out. Also, consider giving me anonymous <a href="https://ngl.link/jibrinx">feedback</a>
                  
## Research Interests
I am a budding researcher with a polymath of interests revolving around:
- **Interdisciplinary research:** medical image analysis, botanical image analysis,economics and computation and computational neuroscience.
- **Machine Learning:** multi-agent RL, representational learning, geometric deep learning, transfer learning, and responsible AI.
