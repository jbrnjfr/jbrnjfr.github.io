## About Me

I am a research fellow working at the intersection of public & environmental health and community resilience at Neureka Technologies inc. we are working together with Dr. Nentawe Gurumdimma on modelling spatiotemporal dynamics and forecasting of Lassa fever and other epidemics in Nigeria. In the past year, I worked as a senior Machine Learning Engineering at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a> in Nigeria, where I lead a small (~3) team of ML Engineers at the GreyAI Lab. We worked in the digital innovation domain providing solutions to local challenges in education and agricultural logistics and supply chain. Our focus primarily was on cross-lingual translation, particularly for low-resource languages like the Hausa language which is popularly spoken in Nigeria. Additionally, I hold the position of CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://app.5minutes.ng">5Minutes </a>(Beta version available on Google Play Store) at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a>. <a href="https://app.5minutes.ng">5Minutes </a> is a mentor-mentee platform emphasizing brevity(<5mins) in content (videos, texts) without compromising depth.

Before joining the industry, I obtined an MSc. degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the Institute for Digital Technologies at  <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/study/masters-degrees/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/"> Loughborough University London </a> (awarded a fully-funded merit-based scholarship),where I was advised by <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/about/staff/dr-xiaolan-liu/">Dr Xiaolan Liu.</a> I also earned a BSc. degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://unijos.edu.ng">University of Jos, Nigeria</a>, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q9VpwWEAAAAJ&hl=enDr. Nentawe Gurumdimma)"> Dr. Nentawe Gurumdimma</a> as my advisor during my undergraduate project. This project focused on the automatic screening of precancerous cervical lesions from pap smear images using transfer learning. My dedication to research led to a research assistantship position in an <a href="https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/K43-TW011416-02">NIH-funded project</a> (Vaginal Microbiome in Cervical Intra-Epithelial Neoplasia and Cancer, NIH grant, K43 project: K43TW011416-02) with <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=39806"> Prof. Musa Jonah </a> as the Principal Investigator. This project aimed at increasing cervical cancer screening uptake and reducing mortality in Nigeria.  Thanks a lot to the support of my advisors and my sponsors, I was able to conduct research and continue learning things that interest me.

I am currently looking fe1or opportunities to deepen my understanding of infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness and leveraging this knowledge to pursue a high-impact career and lead meaningful initiatives in Nigeria and beyond. I am passionate about contributing to better and prepared response in terms of policies, resources and management of novel future pandemics.
To this end, My career goal is to solidify existing collaboration between the Africa Center for Disease Control, Local healthcare providers, and Educational research institutions in Africa for better preparedness, responsiveness and policies in possible future pandemics.

I have been an active member of <a href="http://www.sigecom.org">ACM Special Interest Group (SIGecom) </a> since 2020, Effective Altruism Network (EA Nigeria & EA Global) as well as being affiliated with <a href="https://blackinai.github.io/#/">Black in AI</a> and <a href="https://www.datasciencenigeria.org">Data Scientists Network</a> formerly known as Data Science Nigeria.

In my free time I take pleasure in both watching and playing football. I also volunteer in community outreach and services and have been passionate about social change and giving back to my society by sharing any new knowledge I acquired. To this end, I have volunteered in tech-related training programs and also taken up the initiative of developing a mentor-mentee platform (FiveMinutes, demo available <a href="https://5minutes.greysoft.com.ng">here</a>) to aid seamless and large-scale mentoring. I have recently launched a digital technology mentorship program to provide guidance and opportunities for youths to engage in positive, productive activities in the tech industry. For emphasis, Let me this to highlight the severity of the situation. If you randomly sampled 100 youths in my local area, 65 are involved in internet scams, and the remaining 35 are at risk of eventually getting into it. Crime succeed because of one thing the government doesn't do: it cares but let's Keep the blame game aside, this is our collective failure as a society. I have decided to be the humming bird and I am doing the best I can.
