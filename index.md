## About Me


I'm the Principal Machine learning Scientist at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a> in Nigeria, where I lead a small team that mostly works on cross-lingual translation of low-resource languages particularly the Hausa Language. At <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a>, I also work as the CEO and Co-founder of 5Minutes - A mentor-mentee platform with emphasis on contents (videos, texts) brevity without compromising depth. I received an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the Institute for Digital Technologies at  <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/study/masters-degrees/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/"> Loughborough University London </a> and a BSc degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://unijos.edu.ng">University of Jos</a>, Nigeria.

Feel free email me for research, collaborations, or a casual chat. I especially encourage ml interns, disadvantaged, or underrepresented students to reach out. Also, consider giving me an  <a href="https://ngl.link/jibrinx">anonymous feedback</a>
