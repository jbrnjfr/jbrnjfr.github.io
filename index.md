## About Me


I work as the Principal Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a> in Nigeria, where I lead a small team of ML Engineers at the GreyAI Lab that mostly works on cross-lingual translation of low-resource languages particularly the Hausa Language. At <a href="https://greysoft.ng">Greysoft Technologies</a>, I also work as the CEO and Co-founder of 5Minutes - A mentor-mentee platform with emphasis on contents (videos, texts) brevity without compromising depth. I received an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the Institute for Digital Technologies at  <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/study/masters-degrees/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/"> Loughborough University London </a> where I was advised by <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/about/staff/dr-xiaolan-liu/">Dr Xiaolan Liu </a>. I also hold a BSc degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://unijos.edu.ng">University of Jos, Nigeria</a>. I was advised by  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q9VpwWEAAAAJ&hl=enDr. Nentawe Gurumdimma)"> Dr. Nentawe Gurumdimma</a> during His undergraduate project which focused on the automatic screening of precancerous cervical lesions from pap smear images using transfer learning. This project earned me a research assistantship position at an NIHR-funded research (Vaginal Microbiome in Cervical Intra-Epithelial Neoplasia and Cancer, NIHR grant,
K43 project: K43TW011416) aimed at increasing cervical cancer screening intake and reducing mortality in Nigeria. I am an active member of ACM Special Interest Group (SigEcon, since 2020), Black in AI, and Data Science Nigeria.

Apart from my evident passion for research, I find great pleasure in both watching and actively participating in various sports, with a particular fondness for football. My allegiance to Arsenal FC remains unwavering, rooted in my admiration for Thierry Henry (Gunner's Greatest of all Times) since my childhood; his journey aligning with my steadfast support for the club to this day.

I have two favourite quotes:...<span style="color:indigo;"> "If you do not strive for excellence in your endeavours, you have lost your purpose." </span> and <span style="color:indigo;">"Sincerity is a better 'persuasion tactic' than any trick you can learn." The first quote is by <a href="https://manzomaigari.com/#/">Dr. Manzo Maigari</a> while the latter is by <a href="https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/1336432412285231104">Michael</a></span>

Last but not least, I appreciate you taking the time to surf the internet this far to check up on and to read a bit of my story. I encourage you to say hello before you leave for our interesting conversations to come.. Also, consider giving me an  <a href="https://ngl.link/jibrinx">anonymous feedback</a>
