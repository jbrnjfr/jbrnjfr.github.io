  - title: "Collaborative project with WeAreTheNews startup"
    authors: As the unit team lead for the collaborative project between Loughborough university London and WeAreTheNews startup (https://www.wearethenews.com), I championed ideas on 1. The integration of blockchain in news to revolutionise transparency, ownership, and monetization. 2. Enhancing news article credibility by ensuring the immutability of news articles. 3. Smart contracts to automate fair revenue distribution 4. Proposed the WATN coin to enable micropayments for precise content consumption. 5. Developed measures to ensure GDPR compliance.

  - title: "Deep Q network for optimal irrigation scheduling in Northern Nigeria"
    authors: "Deep reinforcement learning holds significant promise for optimizing irrigation scheduling in diverse cropping systems. By adapting water amounts based on multiple measurements, the framework aims to uncover an intelligent decision rule, demonstrated effectively through a case study in Australian wheat farming, maximizing profits. The versatile model, tested in Goondiwindi, applies to various cropping systems, addressing realistic optimization challenges."    # conference_short: CVPR
