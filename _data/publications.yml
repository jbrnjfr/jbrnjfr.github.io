  - title: "Collaborative project with WeAreTheNews startup"
    authors: As the unit team lead for the collaborative project between Loughborough university London and WeAreTheNews startup (https://www.wearethenews.com), I championed ideas on 1. The integration of blockchain in news to revolutionise transparency, ownership, and monetization. 2. Enhancing news article credibility by ensuring the immutability of news articles. 3. Smart contracts to automate fair revenue distribution 4. Proposed the WATN coin to enable micropayments for precise content consumption. 5. Developed measures to ensure GDPR compliance.

  - title: "Deep Q network for optimal irrigation scheduling in Northern Nigeria"
    authors: "Deep reinforcement learning has considerable potential to improve irrigation scheduling in many cropping systems by applying adaptive amounts of water based on various measurements over time. The goal is to discover an intelligent decision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes sensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case study of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where profits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state variable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil water for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative irrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate irrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day. The production system was simulated at Goondiwindi using the APSIM-Wheat crop model. The framework is general and applicable to a wide range of cropping systems with realistic optimisation problems.
